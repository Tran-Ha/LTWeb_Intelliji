Jaffe là Giáo sư Tài chính. MBA đại học Chicago, ông cũng tham gia tư vấn cho nhiều định chế tài chính lớn ở Hoa Kì cùng nhiều công trình nghiên cứu cho lĩnh vực tài chính hiện đại.;Chúng ta thường xuyên thấy các tin tức kinh tế hàng ngày về các thương vụ mua bán, hợp nhất và sáp nhập doanh nghiệp (Mergers and Acquisitions) , giá cả và thay đổi mức xếp hạng tín nhiệm đối với các loại trái phiếu dưới mức đầu tư, các doanh nghiệp thực hiện tái cấu trúc tài chính, huy động vốn thông qua chào bán cổ phần ra công chúng lần đầu (IPO) , các vụ phá sản và sự cập nhập liên tục các công cụ phái sinh (Derivaties) . Ngoài ra, ngày nay khi thẩm định các dự án đầu tư, để đảm bảo kết quả thẩm định là chính xác và đúng, các nhà quản trị tài chính phải biết tính đến các quyền chọn thực (real options) . Và khi doanh nghiệp huy động vốn để tài trợ dự án đầu tư mới thì ngoài những kênh tài trợ truyền thống, thì những thay đổi mới trong vốn cổ phần tư nhân (private equity) , vốn mạo hiểm (venture capital) , các khoản vay thế chấp bằng bất động sản dưới chuẩn (subprime mortgages) , các khoản cứu trợ (bailouts) và các khoảng các tín dụng của nền kinh tế (credit spreads) là những kiến thức mà các bạn sẽ được giới thiệu trong quyển sách Tài Chính Doanh Nghiệp.;ỨNG DỤNG TÀI CHÍNH DOANH NGHIỆP;Hệ thống tài chính trong doanh nghiệp được ví như hệ thống tuần hoàn máu trong cơ thể nuôi tất cả các bộ phận và toàn thể. Tài chính có thể nằm dưới dạng tiền, vật tư, nguyên liệu, tài sản phát sinh lúc hình thành nguồn vốn hoặc trong quá trình hoạt động như các khoản phải thu, phải trả.;1. BÀI TOÁN TÀI CHÍNH: THU - CHI > 0;Tất cả bài toán tài chính đều quy về các dạng: doanh thu - chi phí, nguồn thu - vốn đầu tư, lợi nhuận = doanh thu - chi phí, thu nhập ròng = thực thu - thực chi...;Các khoản chi phân bổ cho các lĩnh vực là (1) nhân lực, công nghệ, tổ chức, quy trình; và (2) khách hàng (và đối tác), tài chính.;Trong khi đó, các khoản thu lại chỉ đến từ khách hàng và lĩnh vực tài chính mà thôi.;Khi tái cấu trúc tài chính doanh nghiệp, ta đừng bỏ sót khoản mục chi hoặc thu nào và mức độ ưu tiên giải quyết để tăng thu, giảm chi đến hết mức nhằm tối đa hóa lợi nhuận doanh nghiệp.;Các doanh nghiệp Việt Nam thường gặp phải bốn vấn đề khi giải bài toán tài chính. Đó là:;• Quản lý nguồn thu, nguồn chi căn cứ trên ước lượng, dự đoán, thiếu phân tích nên không thấy hết nguồn thu, không cắt giảm được chi phí.;• Kiểm soát công nợ chưa thường xuyên, chặt chẽ, chưa có chính sách xử lý nợ rốt ráo dễ dẫn đến thiếu tiền.;• Kiểm soát không chặt chẽ vật tư hàng hóa, xuất nhập tồn kho, trên đường đi, hàng gửi làm lãng phí vốn.;• Không có kế hoạch tài chính, thậm chí không kiểm soát được dòng tiền, kế hoạch thu trả nợ.;2. NGUYÊN TẮC THU CHI;Nguyên tắc thu chi cần đảm bảo vấn đề:;• Có kế hoạch (nhất là kế hoạch dòng tiền);• Cân đối thu chi;• Chi đầu tư và ROI (thu lại vốn đầu tư);“Tăng thu, giảm chi” nghe có vẻ đơn giản nhưng không có chi (đầu tư) làm sao có nguồn thu? Cần tách bạch giữa đầu tư (thu chi của dự án đầu tư) và các khoản chi cho hoạt động sản xuất kinh doanh thường xuyên của doanh nghiệp mới đánh giá được hiệu quả đầu tư cũng như lợi nhuận của doanh nghiệp. Nhiều khi mù quáng cắt hết khoản đầu tư cho phát triển, chỉ nhằm vào những hoạt động đẻ ra tiền ngay với lý do giảm chi để cắt lỗ mà không đánh giá kỹ kết quả đầu tư sẽ dẫn đến việc doanh nghiệp không còn sản phẩm sáng tạo, hoặc không có sản phẩm mới có tính cạnh tranh. Một nguyên tắc cố thủ khác: “Có thu mới có chi - liệu cơm gắp mắm” với lý do an toàn tài chính nhưng lúc muốn phát triển cũng dẫn đến bài toán cân đối đầu tư như trên.;3. KẾ HOẠCH TÀI CHÍNH;Lập kế hoạch tài chính là dùng một số giả định như dự báo doanh thu, chi phí... và các báo cáo tài chính (dòng tiền, bảng cân đối, thu nhập...) vài năm trước đó để đưa ra các báo cáo tài chính trong tương lai nhằm vào các mục tiêu và ưu tiên của doanh nghiệp. Nhưng tình hình thực tế thay đổi rất nhanh nên để có phản ứng linh hoạt hơn ta có thể lập mô hình tài chính.;Mô hình tài chính (financial modell) là mô hình cho thấy tình trạng tài chính thực tế của doanh nghiệp. Nó bao gồm quá khứ, hiện tại và dự đoán nhiều năm liên tục cho các bản báo cáo tài chính (dòng tiền, bảng cân đối, thu nhập...). Quá trình lập mô hình tài chính như sau:;• Báo cáo tài chính của công ty trong quá khứ (start-up không có).;• Các giả định bao gồm ý định của nhà đầu tư, thông tin về thị trường, tình hình cạnh tranh, các báo cáo về ngành kinh doanh, lợi thế cạnh tranh, mô hình kinh doanh, từ đó đưa ra hết các giả định về thu và chi (giá thành, giá bán...).;• Lập báo cáo dự đoán “kết quả hoạt động kinh doanh, bảng cân đối kế toán và báo cáo lưu chuyển tiền tệ”.;• Định giá doanh nghiệp bằng phương pháp chiết khấu dòng tiền.;• Định giá doanh nghiệp bằng phương pháp so sánh (lựa chọn các doanh nghiệp niêm yết hoạt động trong cùng ngành nghề để so sánh với doanh nghiệp cần định giá, thu thập và điều chỉnh các dữ liệu và chỉ số tài chính trước khi áp dụng định giá bằng phương pháp số nhân).;• Tổng hợp và liên kết hai phương pháp định giá để ra giá trị cuối cùng của doanh nghiệp, thể hiện bằng đồ thị định giá.;	NXB Kinh tế TP.Hồ Chí Minh	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/667_0.jpg	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/667_1.jpg	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/667_2.jpg	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/667_3.jpg	Ross Westerfield Jaffe

"Don't walk...Run to your closest bookstore. The most extraordinary and valuable book I've come across in a long, long time". (Tom Peters). Do you want to get ahead in life? Climb the ladder to success? Master networker Keith Ferrazzi says the secret is in reaching out to others.

These practical, proven principles include: don't keep score (make sure other people get what they want, too); 'ping' constantly (reach out to your contacts all the time - not just when you need something); never eat alone ('invisibility' is a fate worse than failure); and become the 'king of content' (use social media to make meaningful connections). In this classic, globally bestselling book you'll discover the timeless strategies used by the world's most connected people, from Bill Clinton to the Dalai Lama. And you'll learn how to transform your own network, career and life. "A step-by-step way to build relationships with anyone. The tone is engaging and the advice practical". (New York Times).

674	Secrets of the Millionaire Mind	126.000	107.100	Secrets of the Millionaire Mind;SECRETS OF THE MILLIONAIRE MIND reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it! Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments? The shocking answer is: None of the above! In his groundbreaking SECRETS OF THE MILLIONAIRE MIND, T. Harv Eker states: "Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!" Eker does this by identifying your "money and success blueprint." We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money -- and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success. SECRETS OF THE MILLIONAIRE MIND is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and "revise" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it. In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen "Wealth Files," which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth. If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!;	Secrets of the Millionaire Mind;SECRETS OF THE MILLIONAIRE MIND reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it!

The other books in the series are "Fooled by Randomness, Antifragile, "and "The Bed of Procrustes.";	The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a New Section: "On Robustness and Fragility";"The Black Swan "is a standalone book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb s landmark Incerto series, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision-making in a world we don t understand. The other books in the series are "Fooled by Randomness, Antifragile, "and "The Bed of Procrustes.";A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.;Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the impossible.;For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. In this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don t know, and this second edition features a new philosophical and empirical essay, On Robustness and Fragility, which offers tools to navigate and exploit a Black Swan world. Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, "The Black Swan" will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. "The Black Swan" is a landmark book itself a black swan.;Praise for Nassim Nicholas Taleb The most prophetic voice of all. " GQ" "" Praise for "The Black Swan" [A book] that altered modern thinking. "The Times" (London) A masterpiece. Chris Anderson, editor in chief of "Wired, "author of" The Long Tail" "" Idiosyncratically brilliant. Niall Ferguson, "Los Angeles Times" "" "The Black Swan" changed my view of how the world works. Daniel Kahneman, Nobel laureate [Taleb writes] in a style that owes as much to Stephen Colbert as it does to Michel de Montaigne. . . .

THALER: WINNER OF THE 2017 NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS;Shortlisted for the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award ECONOMIST, FINANCIAL TIMES and EVENING STANDARD books of the year;	RICHARD H. THALER: WINNER OF THE 2017 NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS;Shortlisted for the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award ECONOMIST, FINANCIAL TIMES and EVENING STANDARD books of the year;From the renowned and entertaining behavioural economist and co-author of the seminal work Nudge , Misbehaving is an irreverent and enlightening look into human foibles. Traditional economics assumes that rational forces shape everything. Behavioural economics knows better. Richard Thaler has spent his career studying the notion that humans are central to the economy - and that we're error-prone individuals, not Spock-like automatons. Now behavioural economics is hugely influential, changing the way we think not just about money, but about ourselves, our world and all kinds of everyday decisions.;Whether buying an alarm clock, selling football tickets, or applying for a mortgage, we all succumb to biases and make decisions that deviate from the standards of rationality assumed by economists. In other words, we misbehave. Dismissed at first by economists as an amusing sideshow, the study of human miscalculations and their effects on markets now drives efforts to make better decisions in our lives, our businesses, and our governments.;Coupling recent discoveries in human psychology with a practical understanding of incentives and market behaviour, Thaler enlightens readers about how to make smarter decisions in an increasingly mystifying world. He reveals how behavioural economic analysis opens up new ways to look at everything from household finance to assigning faculty offices in a new building, to TV quiz shows, sports transfer seasons, and businesses like Uber.;When economics meets psychology, the implications for individuals, managers and policy makers are both profound and entertaining.;	Penguin Books Ltd	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/679_0.jpg	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/679_1.jpg	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/679_2.jpg	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/679_3.jpg	Richard H.

Why do companies go bust? How is it that we have more slaves today than in Roman times? Why does imposing democracy on other countries never work?;The answer: too many people running the world don't have skin in the game. In his inimitable, pugnacious style, Nassim Nicholas Taleb shows that skin in the game applies to all aspects of our lives. It's about having something to lose and taking a risk. Citizens, lab experimenters, artisans, political activists and hedge fund traders all have skin in the game. Policy wonks, corporate executives, theoreticians, bankers and most journalists don't.;As Taleb says, "The symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that's necessary for fairness and justice, and the ultimate BS-buster," and "Never trust anyone who doesn't have skin in the game. Without it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to haunt them".;	Penguin	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/681_0.jpg	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/681_1.jpg	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/681_2.jpg	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/681_3.jpg	Nassim Nicholas Taleb

Why are all forecasters con-artists? What can Catherine the Great's lovers tell us about probability? Why should you never run for a train or read a newspaper? This book is all about Black Swans: the random events that underlie our lives, from bestsellers to world disasters. Their impact is huge; they're impossible to predict; yet after they happen we always try to rationalize them. A rallying cry to ignore the 'experts', The Black Swan shows us how to stop trying to predict everything - and take advantage of uncertainty.;Reviews by Bill Gates: https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/More-Great-Summer-Reading;2/Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role Of Chance In Life And In The Markets;Everyone wants to succeed in life. But what causes some of us to be more successful than others? Is it really down to skill and strategy - or something altogether more unpredictable? This book is the bestselling sensation that will change the way you think about business and the world. It is all about luck: more precisely, how we perceive luck in our personal and professional experiences. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the markets - we hear an entrepreneur has 'vision' or a trader is 'talented', but all too often their performance is down to chance rather than skill. It is only because we fail to understand probability that we continue to believe events are non-random, finding reasons where none exist. "One of the smartest books of all time." (Fortune). "An iconoclastic tour de force...nothing escapes his Exocets." (Evening Standard). "Brilliant." (John Kay). "Excellent and thought-provoking...an entertaining book." (Financial Times). "Wall Street's principal dissident." (Malcolm Gladwell).;	Penguin Books Ltd	ZoeData/book/English books/Business - Economics/Finance/img/688_0.jpg	Nassim Nicholas Taleb
